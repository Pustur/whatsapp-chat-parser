## [3.0.0] - 2020-08-13

### Removed

- **POTENTIALLY BREAKING**: Removed ES6 to ES5 transpilation.  
  This should in theory not be a problem since the transpiled version still contained some newer methods that were not polyfilled, such as `.padStart()` and every browser that supports that also supports all the other ES6 stuff.  
  So in short, transpiling to ES5 was probably never even needed.  
  Having said that I will still tag this as a major release just to be safe.
